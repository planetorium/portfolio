      <h2 class="trail-header push-0">Research</h2>
      <p class="trail-text">The research of this app started with a review of 5 similar applications and looking into competitive analysis. By looking at the competition in the cycling / trail app market, I discovered that many are used by GPS and data through cell phone.</p>

      <h2 class="trail-header push-0">Problem</h2>
      <p class="trail-text">Many cycling / trail information applications offer helpful services and maps to users, but they donâ€™t usually offer offline download.</p>

      <h2 class="trail-header push-0">Solution</h2>
      <p class="trail-text">Our problem can easily be fixed by allowing the user to download maps of trails so that they are not left in the dark in areas where there is likely no cell phone service.</p>

      <h2 class="trail-header push-0">Prototype (December, 2017)</h2>
      <p class="trail-text">The design of this app started with researching various ways to tell users the difficulty of trails. I decided to use the general symbols that you see on skii and hiking trails, because it is an already known marker. I assigned the symbols colours similar to the ones they usually have and created cards with distance information. This application also allows the users to check and uncheck various maps they have downloaded if they do not want them anymore.</p>
